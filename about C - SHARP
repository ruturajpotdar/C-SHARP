/* at top we use "using System" means that we can use classes from the System namespace.
namespace is used to organize your code, and it is a container for classes and other namespaces.
class is a container for data and methods, which brings functionality to your program.
Every line of code that runs in C# must be inside a class. */
// The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.
/* Another thing that always appear in a C# program, is the Main method. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.
Console is a class of the System namespace, which has a WriteLine() method that is used to output/print text. as previous code gave us output "Hello World!" using WriteLine() method. 
If you omit the using System line, you would have to write System.Console.WriteLine() to print/output text. */
// Every C# statement ends with a semicolon ; ps - make sure you use semicolon wisely :)
//C# is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
